# HCQ_US_COVID19
Calculations using IHME Data for Hydroxychloroquine needs for COVID-19 in US.
Includes rationale, some examples of how policy can be improved and comparison of death rates to Marseilles, France.

Answers three questions:
What will the US hydroxychloroquine needs be for solving COVID-19 assuming nearly complete shelter in place?
What is the supply?
What will it cost?

The IHME data was downloaded from http://healthdata.org/covid and is changed every 2-3 days as new data is incoming.
The infection rate used was inferred by using the current death rate as work began on the original blog post which stood at
12,936/401,166 = 0.032246 (source https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/)
