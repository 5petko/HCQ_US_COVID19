# HCQ_US_COVID19
Calculations using IHME Data for Hydroxychloroquine needs for COVID-19 in US
The IHME data was downloaded from http://healthdata.org/covid and is changed every 2-3 days as new data is incoming.
The infection rate used was inferred by using the current death rate as of work began on the original blog post which stood at
12,936/401,166 = 0.032246 (source https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/)
